                    The Jakarta International Competition Forum is a high-level forum that brings together 
                    policymakers, competition authorities, cross-sector regulators, academics, industry players,
                    and the international community to discuss new directions for competition law enforcement 
                    in the digital economy era. This conference is the third in a series of events, 
                    following previous events in 2015 and 2017. Previously, the event took up the themes of 
                    'Competition Policy in Responding to Indonesia's Economic Challenges' and 'Disruptive Innovation, 
                    Competition Policy and Challenges to Emerging Markets'. This year's event will focus on the theme 
                    'Legal Reform, International Alignment & Enforcement Evolution', in line with the repositioning of 
                    competition policy globally in response to developments in intellectual property and protectionism, 
                    as well as the ongoing transformation of competition law in Indonesia.

                    The priority of the event is to produce actionable policy recommendations, 
                    strengthen cross-jurisdictional collaboration, and encourage SME-friendly compliance. 
                    KPPU invites partners to be part of this strategic policy agenda, with exposure to reputation, 
                    access to decision-maker networks, and measurable brand benefits, and invites speakers to bring 
                    independent and solution-oriented substantive perspectives.
